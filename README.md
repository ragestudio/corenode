corenodejs is a multiproposal framework based on NodeJS runtime, it is prepared to implement utilities for development and operation both locally and in production.

Its most important and critical modules including core base
| Package |  |
|--|--|
| @corenode/builder | An compiler based on Babel, basic for the operation and development of the framework |
| @corenode/cli | Allows to use its cli utilities |
| @corenode/builtin-lib | Includes builtin libraries for NRML system |
| @corenode/utils | Includes an important library for the core of the framework |
| corenodejs | Manages the module system, runtime and environment |

> Most of these modules are still under development or have yet to be included

With its module system it allows you to expand the core easily, it also has a natural and functional design and structure.

The project is now in a very early stage where its form of operation is still being defined and how its use will be focused (USE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR REAL PROJECTS), it is mainly focused and designed for use in projects internal that we are developing.

We are also open to any type of contribution, feel free to use it as you like.
