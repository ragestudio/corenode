Corenode is a multiproposal framework based on NodeJS runtime, it is designed to be used on a solution that needs a context controller and a specific development environment that can be easily extended from the runtime itself.

> Works with as base, virtual machines, with manage the context and processes.

> It has an add-on engine that allows expanding the core of the framework from its own package manager. (See Add-on development guide)

> Also has an transcompiler to handle script that are loaded (Including addons, virtual machines)
